Un riproduttore e gestore di podcast open-source, flessibile e facile da usare

AntennaPod è un riproduttore e gestore di podcast che ti da accesso immediato a milioni di podcast gratuiti e a pagamento, dai podcaster indipendenti alle più grandi case editrici come BBC, NPR e CNN. Aggiungi, importa e esporta in modo semplici usando il database di podcast di iTunes, da file OPML o da semplici URL RSS. Risparmia fatica, batteria e dati  con il potente controllo automatizzato per il download di episodi (orari specifici, intervalli e reti WiFi) e l'eliminazione degli episodi.<br>
But most importantly: Download, stream or queue episodes and enjoy them the way you like with adjustable playback speeds, chapter support and a sleep timer. You can even show your love to the content creators  with our Flattr integration.

Made by podcast-enthousiast, AntennaPod is free in all senses of the word: open source, no costs, no ads.
